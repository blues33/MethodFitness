- global error handling
- global msg implemented
    - start adding proper errors and statuses to api calls and displaying via new notification component
- global or at least signin error not staying on screen
  - as suspected this is because the store is cleaned on logout. signin failure leads to logout. I'll figure a workaround
- start thinkng about form or field validation e.g. email phone etc
- more/better logging
- handle past appointments being updated and what that does to the stateful eventhandlers.  it should probably be
handled by the Workflow handler
