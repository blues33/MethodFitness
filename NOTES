- global error handling
- global msg implemented
    - start adding proper errors and statuses to api calls and displaying via new notification component
- global or at least signin error not staying on screen
  - as suspected this is because the store is cleaned on logout. signin failure leads to logout. I'll figure a workaround
- start thinkng about form or field validation e.g. email phone etc
- more/better logging
- handle past appointments being updated and what that does to the stateful eventhandlers.  it should probably be
handled by the Workflow handler

scheduling appointment to new day, both past and future, I schedule new appt, and cancel old. if I keep same id there
is race condition.  so I need to always change id but does that affect state is some weird way?


ok so now, reschedule appt in past to new day keeps the same apptId which I believe is correct
to avoid race condition of delete and schedule. however, drag and drop in past uses reschedule appt
in future logic so appointment now has new id. so either the future should also keep same id or the
  drag and drop should detect the time and react appropriately. make sure to check the appointment reducers as
  they are involved in this shit.



need to look at payments process, and update appointments to say paid:true so we can prevent updating of paid appointmnets



tests
test for archive client takes client out of trainers available clients
write tests for trainer archive ( from the trainer list, the trainer dropdown on appointment, calendar toggle list )
maybe fix the "return to client" button on purchases to tell whether it came from client or clientlist
