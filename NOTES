- global error handling
- global msg implemented
    - start adding proper errors and statuses to api calls and displaying via new notification component
- add logic that you can not archive yourself in trainer list
- global or at least signin error not staying on screen
- dispose of subscription after notification returns.  do this by passing sub with rx.observer in an object and
then passing object to parser, skip putting the await in controller.
