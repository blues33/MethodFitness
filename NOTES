- global error handling
- global msg implemented
    - start adding proper errors and statuses to api calls and displaying via new notification component
- add logic that you can not archive yourself in trainer list
- global or at least signin error not staying on screen
  - as suspected this is because the store is cleaned on logout. signin failure leads to logout. I'll figure a workaround
- dispose of subscription after notification returns.  do this by passing sub with rx.observer in an object and
then passing object to parser, skip putting the await in controller.
- on toggle trainer appointments make it so when you are on "all" and you click one trainer it turns all off except that one trainer now it's opposite
- start thinkng about form or field validation e.g. email phone etc
